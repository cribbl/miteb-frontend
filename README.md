MIT Event Booking Portal is a web application to facilitate the process of booking classrooms, auditoriums and lecture halls for conducting events and workshops by different student run clubs or groups at MIT, Manipal. Until now, the 3 step pen-paper based procedure was cumbersome as it involved manual checking for available rooms and running behind college authorities seeking their permission. We have made an attempt to automate this process and go digital via our web portal. This is the frontend of this system. Checkout the backend [here](https://github.com/cribbl/miteb-backend/)
